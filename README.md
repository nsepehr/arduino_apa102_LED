# Arduino APA102 LED
This is sample code for the arduino type micro-controller lighting up an individually addressable APA102 LED strip

It is based on the FastLED library and thus must be installed before using

This code creates series of animations which then can be randomly selected and displayed on two LED strips

Make sure the _Data & Clock_ pins are connected to the correct pin on the micro-controller
